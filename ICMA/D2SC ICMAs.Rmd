# ICMA Sept 9 2024

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

I see seemingly linear growth.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}

this_is_a_nightmare <- "hello"
2+2
x <- 2 + 2
```
```{r}
?mean
help(mean)

```{r}
?sd
```

```{r}
sd(1:2)^2

```{r}
chick_clean <- ChickWeight %>% ## assigning to a new object "chick_clean"
  select(chick_id = Chick, 
         diet = Diet,
         age_days = Time, 
         weight_gm = weight)  ## renaming & re-ordering while keeping
```

```{r}
summary_table <- ChickWeight %>%
  filter(Time == 20) %>%
  mutate(weight_lbs = weight / 453.6) %>%
  group_by(Diet) %>%
  summarise(
    num_chicks = n_distinct(Chick),
    avg_weight_grams = mean(weight),
    avg_weight_pounds = mean(weight_lbs)
  )
